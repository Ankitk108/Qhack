Resources
Resource estimation is sometimes presented in the following (simplified) flow: pick a quantum algorithm (represented by a circuit of a certain size), compile it, count the T gates, multiply by a per-T-gate time (based on some assumptions), and read off a runtime:

It is often helpful to think of resource estimation in the following alternative direction: given certain characteristics of a quantum computer (e.g, a fixed logical T-gate time, fixed by the code distance and the cycle time, a given number of logical qubits available, and a timeline for the project or for allocated compute time), how large of a problem, represented by a given algorithm, fits within those constraints?

Quantum phase estimation is a good place to ask at a high level, because the trade-off is fairly clean. With

m estimation wires the phase resolution is

so every extra wire gets you exactly one more bit of the phase. It also costs you roughly a doubling of the work, because QPE applies the controlled base unitary

 âˆ’1 times. One more bit for twice the runtime is part of the bargain of phase estimation, and it is a far better bargain than sampling, where one more decimal digit costs a factor of one hundred extra samples/shots.

With (textbook) quantum phase estimation, two characteristics decide the answer to the earlier question of how large of a problem we might be able to run given certain hardware constraints.

The first is the base unitary. The T-count of QPE depends directly on what you are estimating the phase of. If you use a single-qubit rotation, the powers

 (2

 Î¸), so the controlled-powers block does not grow at all, and the cost you measure is in larger part the cost of the inverse QFT. A generic multi-qubit unitary on the other hand has no such structure, its powers genuinely accumulate, and the controlled-powers block dominates.

The second is the rotation synthesis precision. There is no exact Clifford+T circuit for an arbitrary rotation, so every rotation must be approximated, at a cost that grows roughly like

(

 ) T gates apiece.

A key characteristic of resource estimation is that it is a symbolic calculation. It never builds a state vector, so it will easily cost a routine on hundreds of qubits that could not be simulated on any classical computer.

Challenge code
In the code below you must complete this function:

affordable_precision: returns the largest QPE size that fits a wall-clock budget. Its arguments are:

t_gate_seconds (float): the time to execute one logical T gate, in seconds.
budget_seconds (float): the total wall-clock budget, in seconds.
max_estimation_wires (int): a safety bound on the search. A correct model never reaches it.
Take the base unitary to be a generic two-qubit unitary, qre.QubitUnitary(num_wires=2), and build phase estimation on it with qre.QPE. Cost it in the gate set GATE_SET provided in the code, with the single-qubit rotation precision set to ROTATION_PRECISION through a qre.ResourceConfig.

The runtime of a size is its T-count times t_gate_seconds, and a size is affordable when that runtime is no greater than budget_seconds. You want the largest affordable m. Because the T-count grows monotonically in m, you may stop at the first size that overruns.

There are two rules on how the answer is reached, both enforced by tests:

The T-count you return must match what qre.estimate reports at the size you return. Reading it out of the result object is the point of the exercise, rather than reproducing it from a formula worked out beforehand.
Your search must cost more than one size. Finding the largest size that fits means comparing sizes, so qre.estimate has to be called at least twice. How you search is up to you. For example, a scan upwards from m = 1 and a binary search both pass.
Input
A Python list of two floats, [t_gate_seconds, budget_seconds]:

t_gate_seconds (float): the time to execute one logical T gate, in seconds.
budget_seconds (float): the total wall-clock budget, in seconds.
Output
A Python tuple of three values, (num_estimation_wires, precision, t_count):

num_estimation_wires (int): the largest affordable m.
precision (float): the phase resolution 2 ** -m that size buys.
t_count (int): the T-count at that size, as reported by qre.estimate.
The wire count and the T-count are compared exactly, so cast them with int(...); the resolution is compared to a relative tolerance of 1e-12, which any of 2.0 ** -m, 0.5 ** m or 1 / 2 ** m will satisfy. Return plain Python numbers rather than NumPy scalars, a NumPy integer or boolean cannot be serialised by the grader.

Test cases
Two test cases are shown to you; the remaining cases are hidden and run when you submit.

As an example, for input [1e-06, 1.0], your solution should output (9, 0.001953125, 684108).

This means that a logical T gate takes one microsecond and you have one second of machine time, so the budget is a million T gates. Walking up the sizes, m = 9 costs 684,108 T gates, which is 0.684 seconds and fits, while m = 10 costs 1,366,956 T gates, which is 1.367 seconds and does not. So nine wires is the largest affordable size, and it gets you a phase resolution of
